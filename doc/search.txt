There are five indexes: 
One each for documents, transcripts, footnotes, topics and notes.

What exactly is indexed for each of these?

For documents, the full text of the bibliographic information for the
document is indexed. Currently the topics assigned to the document are
NOT indexed. For example:

Woman Suffrage. The Argument of Carrie S. Burnham before Chief Justice
Reed, and Associate Justices Agnew, Sharswood and Mercur, of the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in Banc, on the Third and Fourth of
April, 1873. Philadelphia: Citizenâ€™s Suffrage Association, 1873.

For transcripts, the full text of the transcript is indexed.

For footnotes, the full text of the footnote is indexed. Currently the
footnoted text (i.e. the text in a transcript to which the footnotes
is attached) is NOT indexed. For example:

When the women pickets were forcibly fed in Washington Jail, they were
told by a gentleman from Congress that if they would stop hunger
striking, they would be given all the privileges of political
Prisoners but would not be recognized as such, for that would
automatically establish a political status which a Democracy could not
tolerate.

For topics, the preferred name, aliases (if any), and full text of the
topic summary (if one exists) are indexed. The related topics are NOT
indexed. For example:

Rankin, Jeannette (1880-1973)
Montana social worker, suffragist and politician. Graduating from the
University of Montana in 1912...

For notes, the full text of the main content of the note as well as
the full text of any citation-specific notes are indexed. Currently
the title of the note is NOT indexed, the topics assigned to the note
are NOT indexed, and the bibliographic information in the citations is
NOT indexed. For example:

Notes on relationship between Rompapas and Margaret Sanger
JR ought to be a closed book & yet I feel, have a very strong feeling
somehow that you are waiting.  You said at Provincetown...
